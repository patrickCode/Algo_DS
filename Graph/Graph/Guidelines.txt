Problems
1. DFS
2. BFS
3. HasPath
	Time: O(e) or O(n^2) - Since a graph with e edges can have max n^2 nodes
	Space: O(n) - Since we need to store n nodes in the data structure (stack or queue)
4. Undirected graph - Cycle
	Since no directions are specificed in an undirected graph, there can cycles in the graph. So when we are traversinga undirected graph we need to ensure that we handle the 
	scenarios of keeping a track of all the visited nodes so that we can avoid cycles.
	In an undirected graph, generally a edge list is given, that needs to be converted into an adjacency list (for better traversal)
5. Connected components count
